# TODOS

## Radio service

### Harden the stream against broken receivers and bad frames

**What:** Close the edge cases the feat/compact-stream reviews left open: deadlines for receivers that stop sending usable audio, size and range caps in the browser decoder, and two test gaps.

**Why:** Each needs a broken or hostile receiver, a corrupted radio service or rare timing, so none affects working receivers today. But a bad receiver can still hold one of the `MAX_SESSIONS` listener slots for the full session limit, and a bad frame can still stall a tab.

**Context:** All raised by the /ship reviews of feat/compact-stream and deferred on 2026-10-20 so the PR could land:
- `KiwiClient.blocks()` (`apps/radio/skywave_radio/kiwi.py`) restarts its timeout on every frame, so a receiver that sends MSG frames but no SND blocks never times out. Track the last SND frame there (this predates the branch).
- The empty-block deadline in `ListenSession._run` (`session.py`) can be dodged with 1-sample blocks. A minimum sample rate (samples per second over a window) would catch that. Also measure it from the last real audio after the sends finish, not before: a 10-15 s browser stall followed by an empty block currently blames a healthy receiver.
- `handleBinary` (`apps/web/src/lib/use-radio.ts`) has no upper bound on an audio frame's size, and checks only that a spectrum row's base is finite, not the decoded values (a base near the float32 maximum overflows to Infinity).
- `test_receiver_sending_only_empty_blocks_times_out` would hang until the 60-minute session limit if the deadline regressed. Give it a short `max_session_minutes`. Add a test that the deadline resets after real audio (FakeKiwi sending an empty block every Nth frame).

**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Retry the old Kiwi path only for a Kiwi that needs it

**What:** Add a single retry on `/<ts>/SND` when `/kiwi/<ts>/SND` gets no reply, but only after a receiver proves it needs one.

**Why:** PR #6 moved to `/kiwi/<ts>/SND` because current firmware ignores the bare path. Every receiver tested on 2026-10-20 answered `/kiwi/`, so there is no fallback. A blind retry would make every dead receiver take 20 s to fail instead of 10 s.

**Context:** Trigger: a live Kiwi fails with "connected but never answered" **and** a probe shows it answers `/<ts>/SND` but not `/kiwi/<ts>/SND`. Without that proof, don't add the retry. The path is built in `KiwiClient.url`, and `connect` raises the timeout (`apps/radio/skywave_radio/kiwi.py`). Note: a leftover host `uvicorn` on `127.0.0.1:8765` once made fixed receivers look broken; check `lsof -nP -iTCP:8765 -sTCP:LISTEN` before blaming the Kiwi.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P4
**Depends on:** A receiver that reproduces the failure

## Web app

### Decide what Preset.receiverHost / receiverPort become

**What:** Replace or wire up the unused `receiverHost`/`receiverPort` columns on `Preset` when the receiver map lands.

**Why:** The schema implies presets can be pinned to a receiver, but the UI never sends these fields (`Presets.tsx`), even though the API accepts them (`presets.ts`). Kept as-is on 2026-10-20 to avoid a migration the Receiver table would redo.

**Context:** `apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma:16-17`. The planned `Receiver` table (README "Next steps" 1) probably turns these into a foreign key. Decide then instead of building the free-text version now.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Receiver map / `Receiver` table

### Drop the browser's float32 frame decoding

**What:** Remove the `0x01`/`0x02` branches from `handleBinary` (`apps/web/src/lib/use-radio.ts`) and their test.

**Why:** They exist only so the web app could deploy before the radio service during the switch to compact frames. Once every running radio service sends `0x03`/`0x04`, they are dead code.

**Context:** Added with the int16/uint8 frame change (feat/compact-stream). Safe to remove once no radio service from before that change is deployed anywhere this web app points.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P4
**Depends on:** Every radio service deployment on the compact frames

## Completed

### Halve stream bandwidth with int16 audio

**What:** Send audio frames as int16 (and optionally spectrum rows as uint8 dB) instead of float32.

**Why:** Cuts per-listener bandwidth from 556 kbit/s (measured 2026-10-20, ~250 MB per listening hour) to 238 kbit/s. Matters most for metered/mobile listeners or a higher `MAX_SESSIONS`.

**Context:** Binary frames are built in `ListenSession._run` (`AUDIO_TAG` / `SPECTRUM_TAG`, `apps/radio/skywave_radio/session.py`) and decoded in `handleBinary` (`apps/web/src/lib/use-radio.ts`). Agreed design (eng review 2026-10-20): new tags so old tabs go silent instead of playing noise. `0x03` is int16 LE audio scaled by 32767. `0x04` is a float32 LE `bottom` dB (row 20th percentile minus 20) followed by 512 uint8, dB = bottom + v × 0.5, clamped. The browser keeps decoding `0x01`/`0x02` too, so deploy the web app first for this change. Extend `test_server.py` and the existing `use-radio.test.ts`.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2 (scheduled)
**Depends on:** None

**Completed:** feat/compact-stream (2026-10-20). Measured 556 → 238 kbit/s per listener.
